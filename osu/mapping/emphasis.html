            <h1> Flow and Emphasis </h1>
            
            <br>
            <p> (This lesson is all about connecting the music and the map. The best way for me to match up musical concepts with visual concepts is through videos, so I'll steal a bunch of pishifat's because he has lots of good explanations and examples.) </p>
            
            <h2> Overview </h2>
            
            <p> So far, we have learned when to place circles, and when and where to place sliders. </p>
            
            <p> Now, we'll take a closer look at how placement of objects can create relative emphasis, and how good flow strengthens that. </p>
            
            <p> As a reminder, our target diff will be an Insane, maybe Hard. Once again, you'll probably want to start from an empty map. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Rhythmic Emphasis </h2>
            
            <p> Previously, we've discussed basic rhythmic emphasis, which mappers create via clicking and releasing. However, even though following the song's base rhythms makes a map playable and relates it to the song, it can make for some pretty awful gameplay. </p>
            
            <h3> Short Streams </h3>
            
            <p> One of the simplest ways to add rhythmic emphasis to an object is to place it at the end of a double, triple, or similar short stream. This can often end up being overmapping since the song won't always support such clicking, but that's okay since, as I said before, there are certain times when overmapping is good. Also note the difference between, say, a triple and a slider: <strong>A slider emphasizes its head, a short stream emphasizes its end.</strong> </p>
            
            <p> We also have to take care to add these only when they'd be somewhat expected by the player. It's not generally a good idea, for example, to overmap random triples into a slow section, since this form of emphasis is used for intense segments. </p>
            
            <h3> Fill Rhythms </h2>
            
            <p> Another common form of overmapping is adding objects to beats which don't have any important sounds, but which would otherwise be important beats. For example, a big white tick with no sound might get a circle or slider (head or end) simply because the player <i>expects</i> a sound there. TV Size maps do this especially often so that they have the simplest possible rhythms for the player to follow. </p>
            
            <p> When the emphasized instrument doesn't have a sound on a strong beat (usually a white tick), we always have the option to add fill rhythms. Whether we actually do add something is based on if we, as a playtester, prefer the rhythms with or without it. Since songs often repeat themselves, we should then try to use similar fill rhythms elsewhere in the song to create consistency. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Flow </h2>
            
            <p> Anyway, here's <s>Wonderwall</s> pishifat:</p>
            
            <div class="video"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ig7nTSbWwVc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
            
            <p> And since this is a two-part video, here's pishifat again: </p>
            
            <div class="video"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYGatwQszwQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
            
            <p> As a recap, </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Flow is a nebulous term that describes movement </li>
                <li> Sharp angles are comfortable </li>
                <li> Circular (rotational) flow is comfortable (we mentioned this in the previous lesson too) </li>
                <li> Linear flow can be comfortable </li>
                <li> Repeated movement is comfortable </li>
                <li> Slow movement is generally pretty comfortable </li>
                <li> Kicksliders behave a lot like circles </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3> Comfort </h3>
            
            <p> In addition, pishifat explained that a map with good flow doesn't need to (and usually shouldn't) be completely comfortable. <strong>Uncomfortable movement is a highly impactful way of emphasizing a song's strange sounds,</strong> since the player sees, hears, and feels the discomfort, all at the same time. If you're a big fan of wub maps, you'll recognize their patterning is largely based around this idea. </p>
            
            <p> One source of discomfort that pishifat doesn't touch upon in these videos is that caused by cramped movement. Movement is naturally fun, so keeping (almost) still for more than one second feels... weird. That's not to say that it makes for bad mapping (for example, <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2123087">handsome</a> uses it well in <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/s/720615">Sua Cara</a>), but we should be careful when making cramped patterns, as they create a certain kind of discomfort emphasis. </p>
            
            <p> On the other hand, we must be extremely careful to avoid discomfort that may emphasize parts of the song that should <i>not</i> be emphasized. Previously, I mentioned a slider shape that often randomly appears stops being special; <strong>emphasis that often randomly appears also stops being special.</strong> </p>
            
            <h3> "The Big Circle" </h3>
            
            <p> Here's a weird trend: Almost every mapper will use "the big circle" and its associated flow somewhere in their first map. What am I talking about? Well, if you go into the map and Ctrl-A, </p>
            
            <img src="res/emphasis/bigcircle.png">
            
            <p> Yikes. Movement in such a pattern is generally an awful experience, since it probably rotates in the same direction for long stretches of times, with jumps going around the circle rather than across. </p>
            
            <p> Well then, how do we fix this? When breaking flow becomes a natural mapping skill, we won't even have to worry about it. Until then, we can use some common <i>limitations</i> on our object placement to get accustomed to using the whole playing field: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Jumps must not use angles between 100 and 170 degrees </li>
                <li> Streams must not align with the edge of "the big circle" </li>
                <li> When there are many (3 or more) sliders in a row, blanket something </li>
                <li> The object after a spinner cannot be on "the big circle"
            </ul>
            Note that <strong>none of these imply bad mapping,</strong> but are instead tricks we can apply in order to break out of "the big circle." When we no longer use "the big circle" at all, we can take the training wheels off and map without having to worry about this monstrosity.
            
            <p> The next section will also help with this by covering a number of concepts that will allow us to create much more engaging flow. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Placement Emphasis </h2>
            
            <p> Perhaps the loosest form of placement emphasis is absolute placement. Mappers often use two extremely simple techniques: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> In stereo audio, sounds coming from the left headphone get mapped as to objects on the left side of the play area. </li>
                <li> Intense sounds are mapped by placing objects further from the center of the play area. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> The second is the more interesting one, since it may not be immediately obvious why this works. Start playing any map. I'd bet that you default to placing your cursor somewhere in the middle of the screen. For almost all players, this is the most comfortable hand position. And if you stretch your hand to hit notes in the far corners, you'll feel at least a little discomfort. As said before, discomfort is connected to emphasis, which gets placed on intense sounds. Everything fits together! </p>
            
            <p> (The next lesson will expand upon this concept further, but for now, this will do.) </p>
            
            <p> The rest of placement emphasis is relative, which is to say, objects gain emphasis based not on their coordinates, but on their directions and distances relative to other objects. </p>
            
            <h3> Spacing </h3>
            
            <p> I promise I didn't steal this entire lesson from pishifat. </p>
            
            <div class="video"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1_HRo-lWWI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
            
            <p> As you might have guessed, the below video was actually uploaded before the above one, but it makes more sense to present them in this order. </p>
            
            <div class="video"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAYm50d6XMw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
            
            <p> As a recap, </p>
            <ul>
                <li> 1/2 beat gaps feel like jumps, 1/4 beat gaps feel like streams </li>
                <li> Spacing helps players figure out rhythms </li>
                <li> <strong>Consistency within the same section of music is vital</strong> </li>
                <li> Consistent spacing doesn't have to be similar to DS (distance snap) </li>
                <li> Spacing places emphasis on the object being jumped <i>to</i> rather than <i>from</i> </li>
                <li> Spacing should increase when song intensity increases </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3> Patterns </h3>
            
            <p> After you display a pattern two of three times, the player will usually stop paying close attention to it and start reading it as, "oh, this is the same as before." Exploiting players' expectations is really easy once we do this, which is why patterning matters so much for gameplay. </p>
            
            <p> What makes up a good pattern? Clearly, there's some visual aspect to it since we'd expect a shape that looks the same to be played the same. And then there's a rhythmic aspect, since a song repeats its rhythms and our map should, to some degree, repeat its rhythms to follow that. We've already looked into rhythmic emphasis, and rhythmic patterning is just made out of repetitions of rhythmic emphasis, so we'll only really look at visuals here. </p>
            
            <p> I promise, this is the last we'll hear from pishifat this lesson. </p>
            
            <div class="video"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FCB5rLXqWKY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
            
            <p> I generally agree with pishifat on the kinds of patterns that look good: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Symmetrical shapes </li>
                <li> Rotated shapes </li>
                <li> Straight lines, especially when parallel </li>
                <li> Circular arcs </li>
                <li> Regular (not deformed) polygons, especially triangles, squares, hexagons, and circles. </li>
                <li> Equal spacing, including outlines and blankets </li>
                <li> Geometric progressions, such as lines that gradually get longer </li>
            </ul>
            You might notice that some of these are the same as the good slider shapes from the previous lesson. That's because good slider shapes tend to follow good patterning!
            
            <p> Pishifat noted that maps that are entirely in-your-face symmetrical aren't so common anymore. And we already know that random placement looks like garbage. Therefore, it's important to find a balance between having no patterning (a.k.a. randomness) and having too much patterning. </p>
            
            <p> Where is that perfect balance? Ultimately, as pishifat explained, it depends on the song. For us, that means there can't be a really nice set of rules that tell us how strongly to pattern a given map. The general concept, though, is that we should <strong>try to make patterns as long as they don't feel forced.</strong> </p>
            
            <p> This will probably make more sense if we look at an example. The specific map I'm looking at is <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/s/504171">Wakusei Rabbit</a> by <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4785223">Nathan</a> since it's got both clear repetition and clear contrast, but the general concepts appear in pretty much every ranked map. </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Since the intro of this song has pretty clean and bright sounds, the map uses lots of repeated shapes with slightly different rotation and spacing. </li>
                <li> As the song progresses, unique shapes are used in a few places, but the patterning remains stable. Nothing is forced into a pattern, but most things that could be patterned are. By changing these patterns up and alternating between many patterns, the map maintains a sense of unity, without feeling boxed in. </li>
                <li> The third kiai is a unique section of the music, so its patterning is different and very precisely controlled: Long notes are mapped with unique sliders, shorter notes are mapped with pairs of sliders that have the same shape as each other, but often don't look like any other pair. </li>
                <li> The song returns to how it was before the third kiai and so does the map. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> Knowing whether a pattern feels natural or forced is a matter of experience, so the only ways to get a better feel for these kinds of things are mapping and studying other maps. </p>
            
            <p> Before we close up, I'll save you some time and effort by giving you these shortcuts: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Ctrl-H and Ctrl-J do flips, as previously stated </li>
                <li> Ctrl-Shift-R rotates objects </li>
                <li> Copy, paste, drag into snap creates straight lines with even spacing </li>
                <li> Ctrl-Shift-F converts a slider to stream </li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
            
            <p> We now have ways of making our maps rhythmically and visually interesting, while adding in some fun movement. We can telegraph similarities in our map with patterns and differences by breaking patterns. </p>
            
            <p> In the next lesson, we'll go into jump patterns and stream shapes, which are more concrete examples of the above concepts. </p>
