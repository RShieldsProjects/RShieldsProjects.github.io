            <h2> Overview </h2>
            
            <p> Previously we looked at flow, emphasis, and how they interact with each other. </p>
            
            <p> This lesson will cover when and how to make jumps and streams, followed by basic shapes to make them look clean. </p>
            
            <p> This lesson, we'll be focusing on an Insane, maybe Extra diff. (Hard and below can't really harness the power of jumps and streams since players at those levels aren't ready for the kind of intensity we'll be talking about.) </p>
            
            
            <h2> Jumps </h2>
            
            <p> Perhaps the single type of pattern beloved by the largest group of players is jumps. Whether jumps actually fun to play or just give pp, players are basically expecting every map to have at least a few. As such, even if we don't actually use any jumps in our map, we should know how to make some that look and feel nice. </p>
            
            <p> Jumps create tons of emphasis when used sparingly, as well as when paired with anti-jumps or strange patterning. Since jumps support many angles of movement, they're also good ways to break up the flow of a map, which we previously noted can be a good thing. </p>
            
            <h3> Rhythms </h3>
            
            <p> Basic jump rhythms are 1/2 spam (red and white ticks). In general, we don't want to map anything too fast with jumps since fast clicking is better mapped with streams. However, with extremely slow songs (under 100 BPM), it may be possible to get away with 1/4 beat jumps just because the clicking will be slow enough. </p>
            
            <p> Advanced jump rhythms are still mostly 1/2 spam with 1/2 sliders and triples thrown in wherever the music skips a note or hits a particularly strong note. These function in exactly the way described previously. </p>
            
            <p> Mixing other rhythms in, such as triples and doubles, is a way to break up the spam, but as we saw last lesson, can also create unnecessary intensity.
