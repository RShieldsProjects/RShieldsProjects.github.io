            <h1> RS' Guide to osu! Mapping </h1>
            
            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            
            <p> <s>Hello there!</s> </p>
            
            <p> My osu! name is <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/10181936">RShields</a>. I've been mapping since May 2017, and I spend a lot of time looking at newer mappers' work. From this, I've found that the same few problems come up often, and I've written this guide <s>so I don't have to type the same thing so much</s> because of how hard it is to find someone who's willing to explain these concepts. </p>
            
            <p> Note: You don't have to agree with everything in this guide! If you ever disagree or have questions about the guide or about mapping in general, feel free to PM me. I'll check concepts for beginner mappers and if you're friendly, I'll mod for intermediate mappers. (I will <i>not</i> hype your map.) </p>
            
            <p> It's okay if you've never opened the editor before. However, I hope you can play 4* and read 5*. Most mappers work in 5* and up, and you'll want to be able to study those. Mapping is also based on feeling, and newer players often just can' tfeel when patterns are good and bad. </p>
            
            <p> I won't cover any modes other than std because I'm not experienced in mapping other modes. I also won't teach the basic functions of the editor, since guides for that already exist. This guide is about how to map <i>better</i>. </p>
            
            <p> <strong> Mapping is subjective. My explanations are my own opinions only. </strong> </p>
            
            <p> With all that garbage out of the way, let's start by asking a simple question. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Why are all maps the same? </h2>
            
            <p> I'm not kidding. All maps made in 2014 and later use the same concepts. Like, rhythms are similar, patterns are similar, slider shapes are similar, etc. </p>
            
            <p> I call this style "modern mapping style." Compared to "old mapping style," modern maps use freeform placement and predictable rhythms. Patterns are about aesthetics instead of perfectly representing the music, and sliderends often land on nothing. </p>
            
            <p> Perhaps the first modern map was <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/s/79498"> The Pretender</a> by <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1047883">RLC</a>. This map won map of the year and singlehandedly changed many players' opinions of what maps should look and play like. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Why learn modern style? </h2>
            
            <p> Even if you hate the modern mapping meta, you still need to learn it because you need to know what expectations current players will have when they open your map for the first time. </p>
            
            <p> If you want to map in old style, your maps will have to be different from true old maps since many patterns from that time have become unreadable, and many patterns that used to be awful are now easy. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Creative Mapping </h2>
            
            <p> Is creative mapping dead? No way. If you look at mappers respected by other mappers, you'll find plenty of cool stuff being made all the time. </p>
            
            <p> Regardless of if you want your maps to be creative or pp farms, you will need to know the basics. All the concepts covered in this guide are important for any kind of mapping. And if you want to break the rules, you have to know the rules first. </p>
            
            <p> To that effect, I've set up this guide around making a "TV Size" map (think, anime opening). Not all TV Size songs are mapped like this and not all maps like this are on TV Size songs. However, this style is so closely associated with TV Size songs that you can ask mappers about "TV Size mapping" and they'll know what you're talking about. </p>
            
            <p> (Honestly, I find TV Size maps boring. But they're easier to study because they're straightforward.) </p>
            
            
            <h2> Setting Up osu! for Mapping </h2>
            
            <p> The settings you use when playing the game may be bad for mapping. Here are the Editor Options that you should use: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> No Snaking Sliders </li>
                <li> No Hit Animations </li>
                <li> Yes Follow Points </li>
                <li> <strong> Yes Stacking </strong> </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> In addition, the skin you map with must have: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>No custom hitsounds</strong> </li>
                <li> <strong>Yes combo numbers and colors</strong> </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> You can map with the skin you play with if it follows those rules. Some people even use the default skin. </p>
            
            <p> I made the skin that I use: <a href="../Tabula_0.2.1.osk"> Tabula 0.2.1 </a> </p>
            
            
            <h2> Getting into the Right Mindset </h2>
            
            <p> Mapping is a tough process. Your first map will be awful and so will your second and third. But, if you stick with it, you will get better. </p>
            
            <p> Consider pishifat's experiences: </p>
            
            <div class="video"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lh19LmL7Nvw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
            
            <p> Improvement is slow. Even if you know about every problem in your first map, you won't fix <i>all</i> of those problems on your second. Focus on one thing at a time. When you're really good at rhythm, you won't have to think about it. After that, you can focus on spacing, etc. </p>
            
            <p> You'll get more experience if you <strong>remap instead of fixing your old maps.</strong> Often, you'd have to change so much to get a better pattern that you might as well start fresh.</p>
            
            <p> <strong>You'll be making a lot of maps in the beginning, most of which you shouldn't upload</strong> since you can only have 4 pending maps at once. Instead, export your map as a .osz, find a good file sharing service, and send via link. Sometimes, you won't even need feedback. In those cases, you don' tneed to look for any. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Topics </h2>
            
            <p> This guide is arranged in order. Each page in the guide (aside from this one) is about one full day of work, and at least 30 seconds' drain time of mapping. </p>
            
            <p> Remember to apply the concepts from all the previous lessons while mapping the next lesson. Eventually you won't have to think about doing these things correctly, but you'll only get there with patience and practice. </p>

            <h2> Special Topics </h2>
            
            <p> There are a few other topics I watned to talk about besides beginning mapping. These aren't in order, and reading them isn't necessary for good mapping, but may give you some ideas. </p>

            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
            
            <p> Now you've finished this guide, you basically know how to map in the standard styles and all you have left is to practice until you can rank a map. From here, you can map anything you'd like, and feedback from other mappers will help a lot since you won't need to make too many big changes in your style. </p>
            
            <p> Remember to continue studying your favorite maps and eventually develop a unique style. I wish you best of luck! <s>Please send me kudosu so i can become a BN.</s> </p>
