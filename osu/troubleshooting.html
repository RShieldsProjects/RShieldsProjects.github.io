            <h1> Help! </h1>
            
            <p> Basically, I'm just documenting all the technical issues I see in #help </p>
            
            <h2> Map list broken! </h2>
            <p> The solution to about 90% of the problems relating to the map list (star ratings missing, maps take forever to load, etc.) is to go into your osu! folder (usually <code>C:/Users/&lt;user&gt;/AppData/Local/osu!</code> on Windows) and delete <code>osu!.db</code> then relaunch osu! and the file will regenerate itself. Every time after this, the problem should be resolved. </p>
            
            <h2> Tablet doesn't respond! </h2>
            <p> If the tablet responds in other windows but not in osu!, go into the osu! settings and try disabling Raw Input and setting Sensitivity to 1x. If that doesn't work, try unplugging any USB devices except the tablet (especially your headset). </p>
            
            <h2> I get this problem: </h2>
            <img src="troubleshooting/nospace.png" style="width: auto; border: 1px solid gray"></img>
            <p> Folder size must not exceed 24mb and you must have a fair amount of empty space on your drive. Also try clearing your <code>osu!/Data/SubmissionCache</code> (it's a hidden folder). If you still can't upload it, export the map to a <code>.osz</code>, then move the original folder to somewhere else and reimport from the <code>.osz</code>. </p>
            
            <h2> I'm in the Upload window but I can't click the button! </h2>
            <p> Click the top part of the window (where it says <code>Beatmap Submission System</code>), then click the buttons. </p>
