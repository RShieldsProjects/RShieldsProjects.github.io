            <h1> RS' Guide to osu! Mapping </h1>
            
            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            
            <p> <s>Hello there!</s> </p>
            
            <p> My osu! name is <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/10181936">RShields</a>. I've been mapping since May 2017, and I've spent a considerable amount of time looking at newer mappers' work. In my experiences, I've found that the same few problems come up often, and I've written this guide <s>so I don't have to type the same thing so much</s> so that newer mappers can find a streamlined path to improving. </p>
            
            <p> If you ever have any questions about this guide or about mapping in general, feel free to PM me. I will check concepts for beginner mappers and if you're friendly, I may mod for intermediate mappers. I will not hype your map unless I reach out to you. </p>
            
            <p> This guide will start by assuming the reader has never opened the editor before. It does, however, assume the reader has played a significant amount of the game, enough to play 4* and read 5*. While it isn't entirely impossible for a less skilled player to become a good mapper, much of this guide relies on comparisons to topdiffs and marathons, which mappers generally put more effort into than lower diffs. Mapping is also largely based on what a mapper finds comfortable, and newer players won't have developed a feeling for that yet. </p>
            
            <p> This guide will not cover any modes other than std since I'm not experienced in other modes. It will provide useful shortcuts when appropriate, but will not necessarily teach the basic functions of the editor. </p>
            
            <p> <strong> This guide explains many topics that have many nuances. If you don't read all the explanations fully, you may end up with the wrong ideas! </strong> </p>
            
            
            <p> With all that garbage out of the way, let's start by asking a simple question. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Why are all maps the same? </h2>
            
            <p> I'm not kidding. When you look at maps made in 2014 and later, they all tend to have similar concepts. Rhythms are similar among similar genres, patterns pretty similar, slider shapes are similar. </p>
            
            <p> I can pretty comfortably say that all maps ranked after 2014 are in what I like to call "modern mapping style." Compared to "old mapping style," modern maps feature relatively freeform placement and relatively predictable rhythms. Slider shapes lean more toward aesthetics than prefectly representing the music, and sliderends have stopped landing on strong sounds. </p>
            
            <p> Perhaps the first modern map, and certainly one of the better-known maps among the mapping community is <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/s/79498"> The Pretender</a> by <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1047883">RLC</a>. RLC is particularly known for the previously noted style choices that now define modern mapping, and it's fair to say he singlehandedly changed many players' opinions of what maps should look and play like. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Why learn modern style? </h2>
            
            <p> Even if you hate the modern mapping meta, you still need to learn it because you need to know what kinds of expectations current players will have when they open your map for the first time. </p>
            
            <p> If you go on to map in the old style, your maps will have to be different from true old maps since many patterns from that time have become unreadable now and many patterns that players now find easy were previously unacceptable. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Creative Mapping </h2>
            
            <p> Is creative mapping dead? Not by a long shot. If you don't follow the mapping scene, you might see lots of pp mapping and think nobody's working on the crazy stuff. Behind the scenes, however, creative mapping has never been better. </p>
            
            <p> Regardless of if you want your maps to end up on the creative side or as pp farms, you'll still need to know the basics. Almost all of the concepts covered in this guide are important for any kind of mapping. If you want to break the rules, you have to know the rules. </p>
            
            <p> To that effect, I've set up this guide around mapping a "TV Size" song. While not all TV Size songs are mapped are in the style I present and not all songs mapped in this style are TV Size, the style is so closely associated with TV Size songs that you can ask mappers about "TV Size mapping" and they'll know what you're talking about. </p>
            
            <p> Once again, you must learn the basics by mapping super boring stuff before you can get to interesting mapping. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Setting Up osu! for Mapping </h2>
            
            <p> The settings you might use for playing the game aren't necessarily the best for mapping. Luckily, osu! has separate editor settings from gameplay settings. Here are the Editor Options that you should definitely use: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> No Snaking Sliders </li>
                <li> No Hit Animations </li>
                <li> Yes Follow Points </li>
                <li> <strong> Yes Stacking </strong> </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> In addition, the skin you play with may not be optimal to map with. There are two extremely important characteristics of a skin that you can use for mapping: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>It cannot have custom hitsounds</strong> because not everybody uses the same hitsounds. </li>
                <li> <strong>It must have combo numbers and use the map's combo colors</strong> since New Combos are very important in mapping. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> Otherwise, the most important part of a mapping skin is that you're comfortable with it. Some people even use the default skin (there's an toggle for it in the Editor Options), but on Insane and above, you can count on players not to use the default skin when playing. </p>
            
            <p> If for some reason, you really want my skin, you can download it here: <a href="res/Tabula_0.2.1.osk"> Tabula 0.2.1 </a> </p>
            
            
            <h2> Getting into the Right Mindset </h2>
            
            <p> Mapping is a brutal process. Your first map will inevitably be awful and so will your second and third. But, if you stick to it, you will get better. </p>
            
            <p> That being said, you'll get more experience if you <strong>prefer to remap over fixing previous maps.</strong> Non-scientific experiments have shown that people tend to improve faster when they emphasize quantity over quality. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't learn from your mistakes, just that you shouldn't spend too much time polishing something that you could create a better replacement for. </p>
            
            <p> Mapping is also an iterative process. Just because you can identify all the problems with your first map doesn't mean your second map should strive to fix <i>all</i> of those problems. Get good at one thing and apply that on every map afterward, then get good at something else. </p>
            
            <p> <strong>You'll be making a lot of maps in the beginning, most of which you shouldn't upload</strong> since you can only have 4 pending maps at once. Instead, export your map as a .osz, find a good file sharing service, and send via link. Even then, unless you're really confused, more practice may often be better than feedback. </p>
            
            
            <h2> Topics </h2>
            
            <p> This guide is segmented and arranged in an order that allows us to constantly build upon previous topics. Each page in the guide (aside from this one) is meant to be studied for at least one full day, and should be practiced with at least 30 seconds' drain time of mapping. </p>
            
            <p> Remember to apply the concepts from all the previous lessons while mapping the next lesson. Eventually you won't have to think about doing these things correctly, but you'll only get there with patience and practice. </p>

            <h2> Special Topics </h2>
            
            <p> There are a few other topics worth mentioning that aren't related to mapping per se, but are definitely worth covering. These don't come with the order or require the practice that the main topics do. </p>
            
            <p> Reading these is not necessary for good mapping, but may give you some ideas. </p>

            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
            
            <p> Once you've finished this guide, you basically know how to map normally and all you have left is to practice until you can rank a map. From here, you can map anything you'd like, and feedback from other mappers will actually improve your map since you won't need to make many conceptual changes in your mapping. </p>
            
            <p> Remember to continue studying your favorite maps and eventually develop a unique style. I wish you best of luck! <s>Please send me bitcoin because I'm poor.</s></p>
