    <title>RShields' Towers of Hanoi</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Towers of Hanoi is a classic programming puzzle. Traditionally, there is a stack of discs, each smaller the the one below it, on the leftmost rod. The goal is to move all the disks to the rightmost rod, with the following rules:
      <ul>
        <li>You may only move one disk at a time</li>
        <li>Each move consists of taking a disk at the top of one rod and moving it to another rod</li>
        <li>You may not place a disk on top of a smaller disk</li>
      </ul>
      I've implemented the puzzle, and a bunch of techniques to solve it.
